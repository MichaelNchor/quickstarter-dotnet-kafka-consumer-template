## üê≥ Docker Support

This project includes a lightweight `Dockerfile` to easily build and run the Kafka consumer in a containerized environment. It's ideal for local development, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment to cloud platforms.

### Build & Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t kafka-consumer

# Run the container (ensure Kafka broker is accessible)
docker run --rm kafka-consumer
